      "title": "Our Mission",
      "text1": "Ruedata was founded with a clear mission: to reduce unnecessary tire consumption and optimize fleet operations through data.",
      "text2": "Traditionally, fleets relied on manufacturer recommendations rather than real-world performance. We discovered that tire wear is influenced by multiple operational variables—not just brand or type. A key insight came from urban transit fleets, where exit-door tires wore out faster due to passenger weight distribution.",
      "text3": "This led us to build an AI-powered platform that helps fleets make smarter decisions, maximize tire lifespan, reduce costs, and enhance road safety. Today, Ruedata partners with global leaders like Heineken, Bimbo, Cemex, and Coca-Cola bottlers, delivering measurable savings and sustainability."
